This extension is an EE 2.0 compatible modified version of "LG Add CP Tabs":http://leevigraham.com/cms-customisation/expressionengine/lg-add-cp-tabs/. The one big difference is that you cannot add tabs depending on Member Group, but every new member you register gets the tabs.

Maybe down the line I can take the time to modify it to work like LG Add CP Tabs worked.

Just drop the folder into the third_party folder, then enable the extension. Edit the extension settings and drop in the tabs that you want to add for all members that you register.

*Format:*
Communicate|index.php?D=cp&amp;C=tools_communicate|1
tab_name|cp_url|sort_order
